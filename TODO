 We need the ability to edit character object.
 From the yellow edit button, I think we should do the following.
 1. allow the character to update their statistics
 2. allow the character Update their name, class, and Race
 3. When they update their class, we should return the appropriate ability.

 We need the ability for a player to delete items from their inventory
 From remove button, Delete relationship between item and character
 
 We need the ability for a player to delete their character.
 1. Create a delete Char button.
